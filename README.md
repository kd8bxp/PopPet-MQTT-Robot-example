I no longer own this robot, I am currently not planning on working on this code. It is left for historical reasons. You maybe able to adapted the code for other two wheel robots, no promises. 

# PopPet 2 Wheeled Robot

Basic MQTT control example for robot. Using a NodeMCU board (ESP8266) with a NodeMCU motor driver board.

## Installation

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rc6zFJoXdAuQ3uHfjGRL2gKZX8IYP2_uwqtnBwkpkiE/edit?usp=sharing
for more information.

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.  

## Things To Do

Would like to add speed control, and find a better interface.

## Usage

There are some test sketches in that directory, they can be used to test various things out.
MQTT_Ultrasonic_timedaction_with_drive is the current working example.
Pictures has some pictures of my build.
